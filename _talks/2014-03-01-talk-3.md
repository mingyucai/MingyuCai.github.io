This paper investigates the motion planning of autonomous dynamical systems
modeled by Markov decision processes (MDP) with unknown transition
probabilities over continuous state and action spaces. Linear
temporal logic (LTL) is used to specify high-level tasks over
infinite horizon, which can be converted into a limit deterministic
generalized B\"uchi automaton (LDGBA) with several accepting sets. The
novelty is to design an embedded product MDP (EP-MDP) between the LDGBA
and the MDP by incorporating a synchronous tracking-frontier function
to record unvisited accepting sets of the automaton, and to facilitate the satisfaction
of the accepting conditions. 
The proposed LDGBA-based reward shaping and discounting schemes for the model-free reinforcement learning (RL) only depend on the EP-MDP states and can overcome the issues of sparse rewards. Rigorous analysis shows that any RL method that optimizes the
expected discounted return is guaranteed to find an optimal policy whose traces maximize the satisfaction probability.
A modular deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is then developed
to generate such policies over continuous state and action spaces.
