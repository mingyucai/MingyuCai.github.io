About Me
======

Mingyu Cai is an assistant professor of Mechanical Engineering at University of California, Riverside. Before joining UCR, he was a research scientist at Honda Research Institute (San Jose Office) from 2023-2024.
He was a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Lehigh University, Philadelphia, PA from 2021-2023. He received the Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in 2021 from the University of Iowa. He also received the M.Sc. and B.Eng in mechanical engineering from University of Florida, Gainesville, USA, 2017 and Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, 2015, respectively. 

Research Interest
======
Mingyu specializes in robotics, machine learning, control, formal methods, and optimization, aiming to enhance applications in autonomous driving, manipulation, multi-agent systems, and human-robot interaction. His objective is to create autonomous intelligence that is both explainable and reliable, providing interpretable assistance and collaboration with humans.

His laboratory is currently concentrating on three key areas:
(1) Control based on learning and perception, guided by intricate temporal logic specifications.
(2) Safe deployment of robots characterized by nonlinear, high-dimensional, and challenging-to-model dynamics.
(3) Developing and validating human-robot systems through the lens of game theory and predictive analysis.
