              <p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach. However, success is limited towards real-world applications, because ensuring safe exploration and facilitating adequate exploitation is a challenge for controlling robotic systems with unknown models and measurement uncertainties. The learning problem becomes even more difficult for complex tasks over continuous state-space and action-space. In this project, we propose a learning-based control framework to satisfy high-level complex task while ensure safe during training. </p>
