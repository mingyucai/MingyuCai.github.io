About Me
======

Mingyu Cai is an assistant professor in the <a href="https://www.me.ucr.edu/"><b>Department of Mechanical Engineering</b></a>
 at <a href="https://www.ucr.edu/"><b>University of California, Riverside</b></a>. Before joining UCR, he was a research scientist at Honda Research Institute (San Jose Office) from 2023-2024.
He was a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, Lehigh University, Philadelphia, PA from 2021-2023. He received the Diploma in Mechanical Engineering in 2021 from the University of Iowa. He also received the M.Sc. and B.Eng in mechanical engineering from University of Florida, Gainesville, USA, 2017 and Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing, China, 2015, respectively. 

Research Agenda
======
Mingyu specializes in <b>robotics, machine learning, control, formal methods</b>, aiming to enhance applications in <b>autonomy systems</b>, <b>human-robot interaction</b>, and <b>AI Security</b>. His objective is to create autonomous intelligence that is both explainable and reliable, providing <b>interpretable</b> assistance and collaboration with humans.

His laboratory is currently concentrating on three key areas:
(1) Control based on learning and perception, guided by intricate temporal logic specifications.
(2) Safe deployment of robots characterized by nonlinear, high-dimensional, and challenging-to-model dynamics.
(3) Developing and validating human-robot systems through the lens of game theory and predictive analysis.

Lab Recruitment
======
<b>Iâ€™m looking for highly motivated students</b> who have strong background in robot control and machine learning, with full financial support. Interested candidates are strongly encouraged to contact me via email, together with a resume including publication list and transcripts.
